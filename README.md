# optimal-transport
This Julia toolbox solves the dynamical optimal transport problem and various extensions allowing mass to vary along transport. It handles:
- an interpolated distance between Fisher-Rao and W2;
- partial optimal transport (quadratic cost, absolute value cost);
- an interpolation between W1 and Fisher-Rao;
- and of course standard Wasserstein distances (1,2);
